# WebProgrammingPractice_Coffeeshop


 
##In this practice with CSS and HTML I tried to get a better understanding of HTML 5, CSS box model and page layout, navigation bar, font choice, etc. Here, You I made a new-realistic coffee shop front page for a fictional DC coffee shop called “sun flower cafe” that sells organic fair trade coffee. 

##Given a skelton folder that contained a skeleton starter.html file and a bunch of useful images/icons.  My goal was to create a page that looks like the attached screen shot.  In the starter .html script, most of the contents are there but there is little information about sections and layout.  In this project I added div/span and created id and classes so that your style.css file can refer to them.
